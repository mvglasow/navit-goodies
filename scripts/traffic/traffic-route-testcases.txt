# This file contains routing test cases for the traffic-test script.
# Each line corresponds to one test case and has the following format:
#
# name from_lon from_lat to_lon to_lat
#
# where:
# name is the name of the test case. Whitespaces are not allowed, and dashes should be avoided (we use them as field separators in filenames).
#    The script also expects two files named name.xml and name-cancel.xml, which hold the traffic feed and a feed of cancellation messages.
# from_lon and from_lat are the start coordinates, in a format accepted by Navit's dbus interface (decimal works). Note that lon is first!
# to_lon and to_lat are the coordiates for the destination, same rules as above apply.
#
# Lines starting with # are comment lines and will be ignored. Empty lines will also be skipped.


# Test with real-world feeds (most of which crashed Navit or exhibited some bug)
